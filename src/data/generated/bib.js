        "abstract": "Background: In medicine, the clinical decision-making process can be described using the dual-process theory consisting of the fast, intuitive \u201cSystem 1,\u201d commonly seen in seasoned physicians, and the slow, deliberative \u201cSystem 2,\u201d associated with medical students. System-1\u2014type diagnostic reasoning is thought to be less cognitively burdensome, thereby reducing physician error. To date, limited literature exists on inducing System-1\u2013type diagnosis in medical students through cognitive heuristics, particularly while using modern electronic health record (EHR) interfaces. Objective: In this experimental pilot study, we aimed to (1) attempt to induce System-1\u2014type diagnostic reasoning in inexperienced medical students through the acquisition of cognitive user interface heuristics and (2) understand the impact of clinical patient data visualizations on students' cognitive load and medical education. Methods: The participants were third- and fourth-year medical students recruited from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who had completed 1+ clinical rotations. The students were presented 8 patient cases on a novel EHR, featuring a prominent data visualization designed to foster at-a-glance rapid case assessment, and asked to diagnose the patient. Half of the participants were shown 4 of the 8 cases repeatedly, up to 4 times with 30 seconds per case (Group A), and the other half of the participants were shown cases twice with 2 minutes per case (Group B). All participants were then asked to provide full diagnoses of all 8 cases. Finally, the participants were asked to evaluate and elaborate on their experience with the system; content analysis was subsequently performed on these user experience interviews. Results:",

        "abstract": "Visualizing medical histories of patients with complex chronic diseases (e.g., discordant chronic comorbidities (DCCs)) is a challenge for patients, their healthcare providers, and their support network. DCCs are health conditions in which patients have multiple, often unrelated, chronic illnesses that may need to be addressed concurrently but may also be associated with conflicting treatment instructions. Future work targeting to reduce treatment conflicts and improve patient quality of life and care should carefully examine and visualize DCCs medical reports, symptoms, and treatment recommendations. In this study, we explore various visualization models and paradigms. We analyze how these models and paradigms are applied to visualize multifaceted medical data. We then propose a model for transforming the unstructured data into temporal slices and depict them in a single graphic model. We report how we carefully moved multifaceted DCC records into; structured data tables, visualization graphs, and various hardware devices.",

        "abstract": "Visualization, a vibrant field for researchers, practitioners, and higher educational institutions, is growing and evolving very rapidly. Tremendous progress has been made since 1987, the year often cited as the beginning of data visualization as a distinct field. As such, the number of visualization resources and the demand for those resources is increasing at a rapid pace. After a decades-equivalent long search process, we present a survey of open visualization resources for all those with an interest in interactive data visualization and visual analytics. Because the number of resources is so large, we focus on collections of resources, of which there are already many ranging from literature collections to collections of practitioner resources. Based on this, we develop a classification of visualization resource collections with a focus on the resource type, e.g. literature-based, web-based, developer focused and special topics. The result is an overview and details-on-demand of many useful resources. The collection offers a valuable jump-start for those seeking out data visualization resources from all backgrounds spanning from beginners such as students to teachers, practitioners, developers, and researchers wishing to create their own advanced or novel visual designs. This paper is a response to students and others who frequently ask for visualization resources available to them.",

        "abstract": "Information visualization as a field is growing rapidly in popularity since the first information visualization conference in 1995. However, as a consequence of its growth, it is increasingly difficult to follow the growing body of literature within the field. Survey papers and literature reviews are valuable tools for managing the great volume of previously published research papers, and the quantity of survey papers in visualization has reached a critical mass. To this end, this survey paper takes a quantum step forward by surveying and classifying literature survey papers in order to help researchers understand the current landscape of Information Visualization. It is, to our knowledge, the first survey of survey papers (SoS) in Information Visualization. This paper classifies survey papers into natural topic clusters which enables readers to find relevant literature and develops the first classification of classifications. The paper also enables researchers to identify both mature and less developed research directions as well as identify future directions. It is a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers in and outside the field of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics.",

        "abstract": "As we track and collect more and more personal health data using multimedia devices and systems, it is getting more and more complex to visualize our health data. This is further challenged as the mobile phone, in spite of its limited screen size and interaction possibilities, is for many persons the main tool for accessing and reviewing their data. We therefore examined how complex and heterogeneous health data can be visualized on mobile phones. We found two different visualization needs: \"My health, now\" gives objective feedback about my current health status, at a glance covering the last 72 hours, and in details on demand for the last 7 days. The visualization of \"my health, in the past\" is needed for reflection and analysis and covers the last up to 6 months. Our findings complement existing analyses of user interaction with self-tracking systems and provide suggestions for future research on visualization of health data.",

To keep abreast of the latest developments in the domain, survey papers and state-of-the-art reviews provide valuable tools for managing the large quantity of scientific literature. Recently, a survey of survey papers was published to keep track of the quantity of refereed survey papers in information visualization conferences and journals. However, no such resources exist to inform readers of the large volume of books being published on the subject, leaving the possibility of valuable knowledge being overlooked. We present the first literature survey of information visualization books that addresses this challenge by surveying the large volume of books on the topic of information visualization and visual analytics. This unique survey addresses some special challenges associated with collections of books (as opposed to research papers) including searching, browsing and cost. This paper features a novel two-level classification based on both books and chapter topics examined in each book, enabling the reader to quickly identify to what depth a topic of interest is covered within a particular book. Readers can use this survey to identify the most relevant book for their needs amongst a quickly expanding collection. In indexing the landscape of information visualization books, this survey provides a valuable resource to both experienced researchers and newcomers in the data visualization discipline.",

        "abstract": "In this work we propose Marjorie, a visual analytics approach to address the challenge of analyzing patients' diabetes data during brief regular appointments with their diabetologists. Designed in consultation with diabetologists, Marjorie uses a combination of visual and algorithmic methods to support the exploration of patterns in the data. Patterns of interest include seasonal variations of the glucose profiles, and non-periodic patterns such as fluctuations around mealtimes or periods of hypoglycemia (i.e., glucose levels below the normal range). We introduce a unique representation of glucose data based on modified horizon graphs and hierarchical clustering of adjacent carbohydrate or insulin entries. Semantic zooming allows the exploration of patterns on different levels of temporal detail. We evaluated our solution in a case study, which demonstrated Marjorie's potential to provide valuable insights into therapy parameters and unfavorable eating habits, among others. The study results and informal feedback collected from target users suggest that Marjorie effectively supports patients and diabetologists in the joint exploration of patterns in diabetes data, potentially enabling more informed treatment decisions.",

        "abstract": "Effective visualizations were evaluated to reveal relevant health patterns from multi-sensor real-time wearable devices that recorded vital signs from patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Furthermore, specific challenges associated with wearable health data visualizations, such as fluctuating data quality resulting from compliance problems, time needed to charge the device and technical problems are described. As a primary use case, we examined the detection and communication of relevant health patterns visible in the vital signs acquired by the technology. Customized heat maps and bar charts were used to specifically highlight medically relevant patterns in vital signs. A survey of two medical doctors, one clinical project manager and seven health data science researchers was conducted to evaluate the visualization methods. From a dataset of 84 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we extracted one typical COVID-19 patient history and based on the visualizations showcased the health history of two noteworthy patients. The visualizations were shown to be effective, simple and intuitive in deducing the health status of patients. For clinical staff who are time-constrained and responsible for numerous patients, such visualization methods can be an effective tool to enable continuous acquisition and monitoring of patients' health statuses even remotely.",

It is challenging to visually couple the large number of multivariate attributes about each region unit together with the geo-spatial location of the clinical practices for visual exploration, analysis, and comparison. We present a novel multivariate visualization we call a cartographic treemap that attempts to combine the space-filling advantages of treemaps for the display of hierarchical, multivariate data together with the relative geo-spatial location of NHS practices in the form of a modified cartogram. It offers both space filling and geospatial error metrics that provide the user with interactive control over the space-filling versus geographic error trade-off. The result is a visualization that offers users a more space efficient overview of the complex, multivariate healthcare data coupled with the relative geo-spatial location of each practice to enable and facilitate exploration, analysis, and comparison. We evaluate the two metrics and demonstrate the use of our approach on real, large high-dimensional NHS data and derive a number of multivariate observations based on healthcare in the UK as a result.
